<h1><em>My Childhood</em></h1>
<p>Hello, I am Mehak Khanna. I was born and raised in India. I currently live in London, United Kingdom. I have lived across various cities in North and Western parts of India including Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Mumbai. Chandigarh, also known as “The City Beautiful” is my current Indian home.</p>

Chandigarh is one of the earliest planned cities in post-independence India and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design. The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, which built upon earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer. Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by a team headed by Le Corbusier, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry. Chandigarh’s Capitol Complex—as part of a global ensemble of Corbusier’s buildings—was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO at the 40th session of the World Heritage Conference in July 2016.</p>
<p>I love the city for its calm environment and the ease of commute which lets me stay connected with all my friends and family around.</p>

<p>My experience of working with McKinsey &amp; Company and ZS Associates has led to my evolution as a critical thinker, collaborative and curious individual. Working in a dynamic environment has nurtured my appetite for risk-taking, ability to deal with complex indeterminate problems and navigate through ambiguity un-flustered. As a technology analyst at ZS Associates, I worked on projects ranging from process optimization, technology transformation and designing growth strategies for clients across pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. As an Analyst at McKinsey and Company, I worked on pricing analytics (growth strategy, forecasting) to uncover consumer behaviour and curate marketing strategies for clients.</p>
