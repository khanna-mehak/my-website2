# Education

I have studied Bachelors in Technology at Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh. During the course of my degree, I discovered my passion for data and grabbed a job at ZS Associates as a Business Technology Solutions Associate. Post an amazing year at ZS Associates, I joined McKinsey and Company as a Junior analyst, and progressed to the role of an Analyst within a short span of 10 months.

During the course of my degree, I discovered my passion for data and grabbed a job at ZS Associates as a Business Technology Solutions Associate. Post an amazing year at ZS Associates, I joined McKinsey and Company as a Junior analyst, and progressed to the role of an Analyst within a short span of 10 months. 

My experience of working with McKinsey & Company and ZS Associates has led to my evolution as a critical thinker, collaborative and curious individual. Working in a dynamic environment has nurtured my appetite for risk-taking, ability to deal with complex indeterminate problems and navigate through ambiguity un-flustered. As a technology analyst at ZS Associates, I worked on projects ranging from process optimization, technology transformation and designing growth strategies for clients across pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. As an Analyst at McKinsey and Company, I worked on pricing analytics (growth strategy, forecasting) to uncover consumer behaviour and curate marketing strategies for clients.

# Interests

In addition to my professional experience, I am an enthusiastic traveller and have been to over 25+ cities across 3 continents. My source of adrenal rush includes trying roller coasters around these cities and I have covered over 30+ roller coasters including the worldâ€™s fastest and steepest ones
