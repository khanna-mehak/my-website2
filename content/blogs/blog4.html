<p>Hello, I am Mehak Khanna. I was born and raised in India. I currently live in London, United Kingdom. I have lived across various cities in North and Western parts of India including Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Mumbai. Chandigarh ,also known as “The City Beautiful” is my current Indian home.</p>
<p>I have studied Bachelors in Technology at Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh. During the course of my degree, I discovered my passion for data and grabbed a job at ZS Associates as a Business Technology Solutions Associate. Post an amazing year at ZS Associates, I joined McKinsey and Company as a Junior analyst, and progressed to the role of an Analyst within a short span of 10 months.</p>
<p>I am currently reading for Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School and am aiming to pursue a career in consulting post my course at LBS.</p>

<p>In addition to my professional experience, I am an enthusiastic traveller and have been to over 25+ cities across 3 continents. My source of adrenal rush includes trying roller coasters around these cities and I have covered over 30+ roller coasters including the world’s fastest and steepest ones</p>
