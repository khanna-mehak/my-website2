<p>My experience of working with McKinsey &amp; Company and ZS Associates has led to my evolution as a critical thinker, collaborative and curious individual. Working in a dynamic environment has nurtured my appetite for risk-taking, ability to deal with complex indeterminate problems and navigate through ambiguity un-flustered. As a technology analyst at ZS Associates, I worked on projects ranging from process optimization, technology transformation and designing growth strategies for clients across pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. As an Analyst at McKinsey and Company, I worked on pricing analytics (growth strategy, forecasting) to uncover consumer behaviour and curate marketing strategies for clients.</p>
