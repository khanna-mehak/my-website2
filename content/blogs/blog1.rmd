This is an AM01 Applied statitics project undertaken by my study group to analyse the Brexit polls. We have tried to visually study how the political affiliation translated to Brexit voting using the data provided. We have described the GDP components over time for 3 countries (Germany, Indian and United States). The breakdown of GDP at constant 2010 prices in USD has also been analysed and is depicted by plots in this project.

# GDP components over time and among countries

## What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

The last chart potrays that Household expendiure has been the major contributor to GDP since 1970 in all the three countries, while net exports contributes the least.\

While in Germany and the United States Gross Capital Formation and Government Expenditure have been almost overlapping, in India, Gross Capital Formation has been evidently higher than the Government Expenditure.\

It is also interesting to note that in India, the proportion of contribution of Household Expenditure has been consistently falling while that of Gross Capital Formation has been increasing.


## What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r gdp_self_made, fig.height=4, out.width="100%"}

# Add column for self-made GDP and add column for percentage difference 

GDP_cal<- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
    mutate(Year=as.integer(Year)) %>% 
    filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName,values_from = value) %>% 
    clean_names() %>%   
    mutate(net_export=(exports-imports),
           GDP=(household_expenditure+ government_expenditure+gross_capital_formation+net_export),
           gdp_difference=(GDP-gross_domestic_product_gdp)/(GDP))

# Plot it
 
 GDP_cal%>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=gdp_difference))+
           geom_path()+
          geom_point(size=0.01)+
          facet_wrap(~country)+
          scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
          labs(x="Year",
               y="Difference in GDP",
               title = "% difference in given GDP and calculated GDP" )+
          theme_bw()+
          theme(panel.grid.minor.x =element_blank())

```

**Answer:**\
It is interesting to note that since 2000, especially for Germany and US the value calculated by formula almost exactly matches the official GDP.
